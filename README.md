#Barbell Machine Learning Project -- Coursera

To reproduce the project, source the "main.R" code.  Because the datasets and objects were included in the repository, they will not be rerun.  The size of the barbell data set caused considerable computing time to generate the models.  At times, a couple of hours for each model.  The "gbm" model never did materialize until the data set was subset to 1000 observations.  "Sourcing" the code will be expedited because the modeling portion is protected by a "file.exists()" function.  Enjoy.
